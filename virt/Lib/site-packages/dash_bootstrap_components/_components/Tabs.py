class Tabs(Component):
    """A Tabs component.


Keyword arguments:
- children (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; optional): The children of this component
- id (string; optional): The ID of this component, used to identify dash components
in callbacks. The ID needs to be unique across all of the
components in an app.
- style (dict; optional): Defines CSS styles which will override styles previously set.
- className (string; optional): Often used with CSS to style elements with common properties.
- key (string; optional): A unique identifier for the component, used to improve
performance by React.js while rendering components
See https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html for more info
- active_tab (string; optional): The tab_id of the currently active tab. If tab_id has not been specified
for the active tab, this will default to tab-i, where i is the index
(starting from 0) of the tab.
- card (boolean; optional): Set to True if using tabs inside a CardHeader.
- loading_state (dict; optional): Object that holds the loading state object coming from dash-renderer. loading_state has the following type: dict containing keys 'is_loading', 'prop_name', 'component_name'.
Those keys have the following types:
  - is_loading (boolean; optional): Determines if the component is loading or not
  - prop_name (string; optional): Holds which property is loading
  - component_name (string; optional): Holds the name of the component that is loading
- persistence (boolean | string | number; optional): Used to allow user interactions in this component to be persisted when
the component - or the page - is refreshed. If `persisted` is truthy and
hasn't changed from its previous value, a `value` that the user has
changed while using the app will keep that change, as long as
the new `value` also matches what was given originally.
Used in conjunction with `persistence_type`.
- persisted_props (list of a value equal to: 'active_tab's; default ['active_tab']): Properties whose user interactions will persist after refreshing the
component or the page. Since only `value` is allowed this prop can
normally be ignored.
- persistence_type (a value equal to: 'local', 'session', 'memory'; default 'local'): Where persisted user changes will be stored:
memory: only kept in memory, reset on page refresh.
local: window.localStorage, data is kept after the browser quit.
session: window.sessionStorage, data is cleared once the browser quit."""
